# March Madness (on Rails)
We have 6 entries - Rajeev, Tony, Albert, Rob, Anshu, and Mike.
 
We will draft on Monday, March 14 at 10pm ET / 7pm PT to accommodate multiple 
schedules.  Please confirm that you can attend at that time.  I’m not sure what 
forum we’ll use – any suggestions?  Based on past experience this draft goes 
pretty fast - should take under an hour.
 
Entry will be $50.  I'm not going to try and collect beforehand... I trust that 
you will all settle promptly when the results are in.
 
These are the categories and prizes:
$100 squad wins (instead of win % to not over-benefit squad with winning team)
$50 squad point diff
$50 winning team
$50 worst seed in 16
$50 worst seed in 4
Last two categories - tiebreaker is most difficult path calculated by lowest sum 
of seeds beaten.  If this is the same, that prize is split.
 
We’ll determine draft order ahead of time.  We’ll have 10 rounds, so we’ll get 
through 60 teams.  We’ll be picking from the full field of 68 – play-in teams 
are available to be picked.  Here’s a [link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Men%27s_Division_I_Basketball_Championship#Opening_round_.282001-10.29.2C_First_Four_.282011_onward.29)
 that explains the new play-in format, 
it’s a bit confusing... but I think it will make for some interesting draft 
strategy.
